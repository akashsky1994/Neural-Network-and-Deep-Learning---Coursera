# Neural Networks and Logistic Regression Implementation and Comparison

## 1 - Logistics Regression
Training Logistic Regression Model to detect whether the image has cat or not with acccuracy around 70%
 
## 2 - Planar Data Classification using neural network with a single hidden layer
Training the Model to detect different color lines on the graph

## 3 - N-Layered Deep Neural Network Application (Leveraging ReLU and Sigmoid Activation Fxn)
Training Deep Neural Network Model to detect whether the image has cat or not with a higher accuracy than the logistic regression model
